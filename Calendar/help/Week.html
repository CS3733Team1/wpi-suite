current day and date of the week.

In week view, commitments and events that have been scheduled for certain dates are shown as blocks highlighted with the color of the category chosen 
for them. Multi-day events are shown as banners along the top of the panel. These banners span the days that the event will take place over. 
Details about them can be found in a tooltip, which will be revealed on mouse-over.
