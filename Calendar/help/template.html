<h1>Adding Text</h1>
<p>Surround help text with paragraph tags ("p" in angle brackets). Each section should have a heading 
describing the section's subject. Remember that linebreaks don't show up unless you use a "br" tag.
</p>
<h2>Adding Images to Text</h2>
<p>Images can be added with an image tag. When adding an image, make sure you copy the image file into 
the help folder (this document's parent directory) and refer to an image as a relative path.
<br>Be sure that you <b>precisely follow</b> the format of image tags given in the example below. 
Otherwise, the parser will break.
<br><img src="question.png" alt="Question mark" width="24" height="24">
</p>
<h1>Adding Headings</h1>
<p>A heading is marked with the "h<i>x</i>" tag, where <i>x</i> is a positive integer which describes 
the level of nesting of the heading. That is, headings provide a way to organize a document into a tree; 
h1 headings are root nodes, h2 headings should be children of h1 sections, h3 headings children of h2, and so on.
