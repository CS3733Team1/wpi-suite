<h1>Summary:</h1>
<p>The commitment class represents a calendar commitment. Commitments are objects that 
have a due date and time, but not a start date or time. Commitments also have names, 
categories, and/or a description. Commitments have their own list panel on the Janeway 
Graphical User Interface which lists all of the commitments. A user can double click on 
a commitment to exchange the list view for a detail view. In the detail view, the user 
is given the option to either edit the commitment or return to the list view. Should the 
user choose to edit a commitment, a new tab will open and auto-populate with the commitments 
information. The user can then change the details of the commitment and save it.
