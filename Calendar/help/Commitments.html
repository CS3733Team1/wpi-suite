<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Commitments represent deadlines. Commitments have a due date and time, but not a start date or time. Commitments also have names, 
categories, and descriptions. Commitments have their own list panel in Janeway which lists all of the commitments. A user can double click on 
a commitment to open a detail view. In the detail view, the user is given the option to either edit the commitment or return to the list view. 
Should the user choose to edit a commitment, a new tab will open. The user can then change the details of the commitment and save it.
