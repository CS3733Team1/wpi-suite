<h1>Adding a Filter</h1>

panel of the GUI.<br>

The panel will change to show the components used to create a filter. Enter a name

filter is applied. Multiple categories can be selected by holding ctrl/command and

button. The selected categories will move to the lower box. Verify that these are the 
categories that should be shown once the filter is applied, and click the OK button.
